    <h6>JACQUES.</h6>
    <p>What have you against me?
    </p>
    <H6>HENRIETTE.</H6>
    <p>Nothing that you're to blame for. It is merely the fault of
        my character; _that_ forces me to refuse you.</p>

    <h6>JACQUES.</h6>
    <p>But I can't see why you----?</p>

    <h6>HENRIETTE.</h6>
    <p>[_With an air of great importance._]</p>
    <p>
        A great change is taking place in the hearts of us women. We have resolved henceforward not to be
        treated as dolls, but as creatures of reason. As for me, I am most
        unfortunate, for nobody ever did anything but flatter me. I have always
        been too self-satisfied, too----

    </p>

    <h6>JACQUES.</h6>
    <p>What _do_ you mean?</p>

    <h6>HENRIETTE.</h6>
    <p>I have resolved to better myself, to raise my moral and
        intellectual standards, and to do that I must be guided, criticised----</p>

    <h6>JACQUES.</h6>
    <p>But you already possess every imaginable quality! You are
        charitable, cultured, refined----
    </p>
    <h6>HENRIETTE.</h6>
    <p>[_Annoyed._]</p>
    <p>Please!</p>

    <p>[_Turns away and sits on settee._ JACQUES _addresses her from
        behind chair_.</p>
