    <p class = "speech">Nothing that you're to blame for. It is merely the fault of
        my character; _that_ forces me to refuse you.</p>

        A great change is taking place in the hearts of us women. We have resolved henceforward not to be
        treated as dolls, but as creatures of reason. As for me, I am most
        unfortunate, for nobody ever did anything but flatter me. I have always
        been too self-satisfied, too----

    <h6>JACQUES.</h6>
    <p class = "speech">What _do_ you mean?</p>

    <h6>HENRIETTE.</h6>
    <p class = "speech">I have resolved to better myself, to raise my moral and
        intellectual standards, and to do that I must be guided, criticised----</p>

    <h6>JACQUES.</h6>
    <p class = "speech">But you already possess every imaginable quality! You are
        charitable, cultured, refined----
