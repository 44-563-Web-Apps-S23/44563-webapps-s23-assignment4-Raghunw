        MODESTY by Paul Hervieu
    </h3>
    
        JACQUES. What have you against me?

        HENRIETTE. Nothing that you're to blame for. It is merely the fault of
        my character; _that_ forces me to refuse you.

        JACQUES. But I can't see why you----?

        HENRIETTE. [_With an air of great importance._] A great change is taking
        place in the hearts of us women. We have resolved henceforward not to be
        treated as dolls, but as creatures of reason. As for me, I am most
        unfortunate, for nobody ever did anything but flatter me. I have always
        been too self-satisfied, too----

        JACQUES. You have always been the most charming of women, the most----

        HENRIETTE. Stop! It's exactly that sort of exaggeration that's begun to
        make me so unsure of myself. I want you to understand once for all,
        Jacques, I have a conscience, and, furthermore, it is beginning to
        develop. I have taken some important resolutions.

        JACQUES. What _do_ you mean?
